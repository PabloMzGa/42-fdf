## üéØ Overview

FDF (Fil de Fer, French for "wireframe") is a computer graphics project that creates a 3D isometric representation of a landscape by connecting various points (x, y, z) through segments. The program reads elevation data from a file and renders it as a wireframe model that can be manipulated in real-time.

The project demonstrates:
- **3D to 2D projection** using isometric transformation
- **Bresenham's line algorithm** for efficient line drawing
- **Real-time rendering** with interactive controls
- **Memory management** in C
- **Graphics programming** fundamentals

## ‚ú® Features

- **3D Wireframe Rendering**: Converts elevation maps into beautiful 3D wireframe models
- **Isometric Projection**: Displays the model using isometric perspective for optimal viewing
- **Interactive Controls**:
  - Zoom in/out with mouse scroll
  - Real-time rotation animation
  - Exit with ESC key
- **Multiple Map Support**: Compatible with various map formats and sizes
- **Optimized Performance**: Efficient rendering using MLX42 graphics library
- **Memory Safe**: Proper memory allocation and cleanup
- **Cross-platform**: Works on Linux systems

## üéÆ Usage

### Basic Usage

**If you built from source:**
```bash
./build/fdf [map_file]
```

**If you downloaded from releases:**
```bash
./fdf [map_file]
```

### Examples

**Using compiled binary (from releases):**
```bash
# Render the classic 42 logo
./fdf maps/42.fdf

# Visualize a pyramid structure
./fdf maps/pyramide.fdf

# Display Mars terrain data
./fdf maps/mars.fdf

# Show Julia set fractal
./fdf maps/julia.fdf
```

**Using built from source:**
```bash
# Render the classic 42 logo
./build/fdf maps/42.fdf

# Visualize a pyramid structure
./build/fdf maps/pyramide.fdf

# Display Mars terrain data
./build/fdf maps/mars.fdf

# Show Julia set fractal
./build/fdf maps/julia.fdf
```

## üéÆ Controls

| Control | Action |
|---------|---------|
| `ESC` | Exit the program |
| `Mouse Scroll Up` | Zoom in |
| `Mouse Scroll Down` | Zoom out |
| `Automatic` | Continuous rotation animation |

## üìÑ Map Format

FDF uses a simple text-based format for elevation maps:

```
0  0  0  0  0
0 10 10 10  0
0 10 20 10  0
0 10 10 10  0
0  0  0  0  0
```

### Format Specifications:
- Each number represents the **Z-coordinate** (elevation) of a point
- Numbers are separated by **spaces**
- Each line represents a **row** in the 3D space
- Numbers **must** be in a square or rectangule form
- **X-coordinate** increases from left to right
- **Y-coordinate** increases from top to bottom
- **Z-coordinate** is the elevation value at each point

**Format is not checked, so the user is responsible for it being well formed**

## üîß Technical Details

### Graphics Pipeline

1. **Map Parsing**: Read elevation data from input file
2. **3D Coordinate Generation**: Convert 2D grid to 3D points
3. **Transformation**: Apply scaling, rotation, and translation
4. **Projection**: Convert 3D coordinates to 2D screen coordinates
5. **Rasterization**: Draw lines between connected points using Bresenham's algorithm

### Key Algorithms

- **Isometric Projection**: Mathematical transformation from 3D to 2D
- **Bresenham's Line Algorithm**: Efficient line drawing without floating-point arithmetic
- **Real-time Rotation**: Matrix transformations for smooth animation
- **Adaptive Scaling**: Dynamic zoom functionality

### Performance Optimizations

- **Efficient Memory Management**: Dynamic allocation with proper cleanup
- **Optimized Line Drawing**: Hardware-accelerated rendering where possible
- **Minimal Recomputation**: Caching frequently used calculations
- **Frame Rate Control**: Smooth animation at consistent frame rates

### Configurable Parameters

The program behavior can be customized by modifying macros in `include/fdf.h`:

| Macro | Default Value | Description |
|-------|---------------|-------------|
| `POINT_RADIUS` | `0` | Scale of each dot of the grid (0 = single pixel) |
| `GRAPH_COLOR` | `0xFFFFFFF5` | Color of the wireframe lines |
| `BACKGROUND_COLOR` | `0x00000000` | Background color of the window |
| `Z_MULTIPLIER` | `1` | Multiplier for the Z coordinate (height scaling) |
| `SPACING` | `10` | Space between each point in XY plane |
| `ROT_DEG` | `1` | Degrees the model rotates every frame |
| `ZOOM` | `0.01` | Zoom increment/decrement step |
| `MIN_SCALE` | `0.01` | Minimum allowed zoom scale |
| `MAX_SCALE` | `50` | Maximum allowed zoom scale |
| `WIDTH` | `1920` | Window width in pixels |
| `HEIGHT` | `1080` | Window height in pixels |

**Note**: After modifying these values, recompile the project with `make re`.
